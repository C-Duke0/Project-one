The Changes of Youtube Video Duration Over Time: 2005 to Now
We plan to investigate if the release of short length video content apps such as Tik Tok and Vine affects the average YouTube video length in youtube. Has the average viewerâ€™s attention span decreased in response to these short term videos? 

Questions: 
Was there a noticeable drop in video duration following the height of Vine in 2013? 
What about the rise in Tik Tok mid 2020?
Did the covid lockdown have an effect on average video duration? [mid to late 2020]
Did viewership increase or decrease with the length of the video?


We used an Youtube Data API v3 that can pull video duration for a random selection of videos in comedy 

Task 1: Generate a random sample of videos for each year Youtube was active

Task 2: Create a DataFrame of these videos highlight the videos, their duration, and viewer count

Task 3: Use MatPlotLib to create a line graph displaying the change in average in video length vs time in years

Task 4: Use MatPlotLib to create a scatter plot displaying the viewership vs video length

Task 5: Draw conclusions and call it a day
